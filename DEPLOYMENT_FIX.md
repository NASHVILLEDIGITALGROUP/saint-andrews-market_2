# SPA Routing Fix for Saint Andrews Market Website

## Problem Description
The website was experiencing "Not Found" errors when refreshing subpages like `/gallery` and `/contact`. This is a common issue with Single Page Applications (SPAs) where client-side routing works on initial navigation but fails on page refresh.

## Root Cause
- **Client-side routing**: React Router handles navigation on the client side
- **Server-side routing**: When refreshing, the browser requests the URL directly from the server
- **Missing server configuration**: The server doesn't know about client-side routes and returns 404

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Server Configuration Files Added

#### Netlify (`public/_redirects`)
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

#### Apache (`.htaccess`)
```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /

# Handle Angular and React Router
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
```

#### IIS (`web.config`)
```xml
<rewrite>
  <rules>
    <rule name="Handle History Mode" stopProcessing="true">
      <match url="(.*)" />
      <conditions logicalGrouping="MatchAll">
        <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsFile" negate="true" />
        <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsDirectory" negate="true" />
      </conditions>
      <action type="Rewrite" url="/" />
    </rule>
  </rules>
</rewrite>
```

#### Nginx (`nginx.conf`)
```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```

### 2. Vite Configuration Updated
Added `base: '/'` to ensure proper base path handling.

### 3. Routing Logic Improved
Enhanced the `_getCurrentPage` function to handle edge cases better.

## Deployment Instructions

### For Netlify
1. The `netlify.toml` file is already configured correctly
2. The `public/_redirects` file provides additional fallback
3. Deploy normally - routing should work immediately

### For Vercel
1. The `vercel.json` file is already configured correctly
2. Deploy normally - routing should work immediately

### For Apache Servers
1. Ensure the `.htaccess` file is in the root directory
2. Make sure mod_rewrite is enabled
3. Deploy the built files to your web server

### For IIS Servers
1. Place the `web.config` file in the root directory
2. Ensure URL Rewrite module is installed
3. Deploy the built files to your web server

### For Nginx Servers
1. Use the provided `nginx.conf` configuration
2. Restart nginx after deployment
3. Deploy the built files to your web server

### For Other Platforms
Most modern hosting platforms support SPA routing. If you're using a different platform:

1. **Check platform documentation** for SPA routing support
2. **Look for "fallback routes"** or "catch-all routes" settings
3. **Configure all routes to serve index.html**

## Testing the Fix

1. **Build the project**: `npm run build`
2. **Deploy to your hosting platform**
3. **Test navigation**:
   - Visit `/gallery` directly
   - Refresh the page on `/gallery`
   - Visit `/contact` directly
   - Refresh the page on `/contact`
   - Test browser back/forward buttons

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- ✅ Direct URL access works (e.g., `https://collegeplace.net/gallery`)
- ✅ Page refresh works on any route
- ✅ Browser back/forward buttons work correctly
- ✅ Bookmarking any page works
- ✅ Sharing direct links works

## Troubleshooting

If the issue persists:

1. **Check hosting platform**: Ensure your hosting platform supports SPA routing
2. **Verify configuration files**: Make sure the appropriate config file is in the root directory
3. **Clear cache**: Clear browser cache and CDN cache
4. **Check server logs**: Look for any server-side errors
5. **Test locally**: Use `npm run preview` to test the built version locally

## Additional Notes

- The fix ensures that all routes serve the main `index.html` file
- React Router then takes over to render the correct component
- This is the standard approach for SPAs and works across all modern hosting platforms
- The configuration files include security headers for better protection
