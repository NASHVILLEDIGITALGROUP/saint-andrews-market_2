# Home Route Fix - Saint Andrews Market

## Issue Description
The website was showing a "Not Found" error when users visited `collegeplace.net/home` directly. This happened because the hosting server was looking for a physical file at the `/home` path, but React applications use client-side routing where routes are handled by JavaScript.

## Root Cause
- The website uses React Router for client-side navigation
- When users visit `/home` directly, the server tries to find a physical file at that path
- The server doesn't know to serve the main `index.html` file for client-side routes
- The existing `.htaccess` file had the correct rewrite rules, but a physical `home.html` file was missing

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created `home.html` in public directory
- Added a `home.html` file that redirects users to the root path (`/`)
- Includes proper meta tags for SEO and user experience
- Provides a fallback link in case automatic redirect fails

### 2. Updated build configuration
- Modified `copy-config.js` to include `home.html` in the build process
- Ensures the file is copied to the `dist` folder during deployment

### 3. Verified existing configurations
- Confirmed `.htaccess` file has correct Apache rewrite rules
- Verified `_redirects` file for Netlify deployment
- Checked `web.config` for IIS deployment
- Confirmed `vercel.json` for Vercel deployment

## Files Modified

1. **`public/home.html`** - New file created
2. **`copy-config.js`** - Added `home.html` to the copy list
3. **`dist/home.html`** - Generated during build process

## How It Works

1. When a user visits `collegeplace.net/home`:
   - The server finds the physical `home.html` file
   - The file immediately redirects to the root path (`/`)
   - The React application loads and handles the routing properly

2. The `.htaccess` file provides a backup solution:
   - If `home.html` doesn't exist, Apache rewrite rules redirect to `index.html`
   - React Router then handles the `/home` route client-side

## Testing
After deployment, the following URLs should all work correctly:
- `collegeplace.net/` (root)
- `collegeplace.net/home` (home page)
- `collegeplace.net/contact` (contact page)
- `collegeplace.net/gallery` (gallery page)

## Deployment
The fix is now ready for deployment. The `dist` folder contains all necessary files:
- `home.html` - Handles direct access to `/home`
- `.htaccess` - Apache rewrite rules
- `_redirects` - Netlify redirects
- `web.config` - IIS configuration
- `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration

## Additional Benefits
- Improved SEO with proper meta tags
- Better user experience with informative redirect page
- Consistent behavior across different hosting platforms
- Maintains existing functionality for all other routes
